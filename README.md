# Python Lesson (Weather App - Final Project) :beginner:

### Scope:
This is the final project of a 9+ hour "follow-along" to a freeCodeCamp YouTube `tutorial series` designed for `beginners` diving into `Python programming`. 

> Python serves as the primary language for the `Girls Coding Collaboration`, a community event dedicated to bridging the gender gap in technology. The initiative aims to offer increased computer science opportunities to elementary and middle school girls. My volunteer engagement with Girls Who Code inspired me to embark on this learning journey through this tutorial series.

### Status
