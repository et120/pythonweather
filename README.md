# Python Lesson (Weather App - Final Project) :beginner:

### Scope:
This is the final project of a 9+ hour "follow-along" to a freeCodeCamp YouTube `tutorial series` designed for `beginners` diving into `Python programming`. 

> Python serves as the primary language for the `Girls Coding Collaboration`, a community event dedicated to bridging the gender gap in technology. The initiative aims to offer increased computer science opportunities to elementary and middle school girls. My volunteer engagement with Girls Who Code inspired me to embark on this learning journey through this tutorial series.

### Notes:

**Set Up:**

**Terminal Commands**
1. `py -m venv .venv` *set up virtual environment*
2. `source .venv/Scripts/activate` *activate on Windows*
3. `pip install requests python-dotenv Flask` *install packages*
4. `pip freeze > requirements.txt` *list the packages so when it is deployed the host can see what needs to be installed, .venv is not pushed to GitHub*

**gitignore File**
- .venv folder *virtual environment*
- .env file *api key*
- __pycache__ folder *created when you use modules*
